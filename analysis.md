## Behavioral Patterns by Score Range:

### 0 - 200: Risky / Bot-Like / Exploitative:
- Wallets in this range typically exhibit:
  - **High-frequency, low-volume** transactions
  - Short lifespans or bursty activity
  - Zero or very low credit inflow
  - Often balance out to zero after a few moves
- Many of these resemble **sybil attacks**, **airdrop farming**, or **drain-and-dump** behaviors.

### 200 - 500: Unstable / Inconsistent Users:
- Moderate transactional activity, but patterns are erratic
- Sometimes spend more than they receive
- No clear trend of financial stability or maturity
- Wallets may belong to newer or occasional users

### 500 - 800: Healthy / Reliable Users:
- Demonstrate **steady inflows and outflows**
- Maintain positive balances over time
- Tend to engage in regular transfer patterns
- These wallets likely belong to **individuals or active users**

### 800 - 1000: Trusted / Long-Term / High-Capacity Wallets:
- Large, consistent credit inflows and healthy balance retention
- Possibly institutional wallets, whales, or reputable service wallets
- Low volatility; rarely exhibit sudden dumps
- Tend to be part of long-term usage cycles

## Conclusion:

The credit scoring model provides a transparent and data-driven snapshot of wallet behavior across the blockchain. The scoring system can be used to:

- Flag risky wallets for further review
- Prioritize trusted wallets in whitelist/airdrop programs
- Enhance user segmentation in blockchain-based applications
